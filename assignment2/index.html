                    <p>Walked around the block a thousand times<br>
                        You missed every call that I had tried<br>
                        So now I'm <span class="blue-word">giving up</span><br>
                        <span class="special-december">A heartbreak in mid December</span><br>
                        You don't give a <span class="red-word">fuck</span><br>
                        You never remember me<br>
                        While you're pulling on his jeans<br>
                        Getting lost in the big city<br>
                        I was looking out your window<br>
                        Watching all the cars go<br>
                        Wondering if see Chicago<br>
                        Or a <span class="orange-word"><b>sunset</b></span> on the west coast<br>
                        Or will I die in the <span class="blue-word">cold</span><br>
                        Feeling <span class="blue-word">blue and alone</span><br>
                        I wonder if you'll ever hear this song on your stereo<br>
                        I hope you get your ball room floor<br>
                        Your perfect house with <span class="rose-red">rose red doors</span><br>
                        I'm the last thing you'd remember<br>
                        <span class="special-december">It's been a long lonely December</span><br>
                        I wish I'd known that <span class="gold-word">less is more</span><br>
                        But I was passed out on the floor<br>
                        That's the last thing I remember<br>
                        <span class="special-december">It's been a long lonely December</span><br>
                        Cast me aside to show yourself in a <span class="gold-word">better light</span><br>
                        I came out grieving, barely breathing and you came out alright<br>
                        But I'm sure you'll take his hand<br>
                        I hope he's better than <span class="blue-word">I ever could have been</span><br>
                        My mistakes were not intentions this is a list of my confessions I couldn't say<br>
                        <span class="special-december">Pain is never permanent but tonight it's <span class="red-word">killing me</span></span><br>
                        I hope you get your ball room floor<br>
                        Your perfect house with rose red doors<br>
                        I'm the last thing you'd remember<br>
                        <span class="special-december">It's been a long lonely December</span><br>
                        I wish I'd known that <span class="gold-word">less is more</span><br>

                        I miss your face<br>
                        You're in my head<br>
                        There's so many things that <span class="blue-word">I should have said</span><br>
                        A year of suffering, a lesson learned<br>
                        I miss your face (miss your face)<br>
                        You're in my head (you're in my head)<br>
                        There's so many things that <span class="blue-word">I should have said</span><br>
                        (things I should have said)<br>
                        A year of suffering, a lesson learned<br>
                        I hope you get your ball room floor<br>
                        Your perfect house with rose red doors<br>

                        (I miss you, I wish you well)<br>

                        (I miss you, I miss you) <br>
                        and that's the last thing I remember<br>
